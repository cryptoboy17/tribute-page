                The Story of Alan Turing
            </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley
                Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the
                section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of techniques for
                speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an
                electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.

                Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat
                the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win
                the war. Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it is hard to estimate the precise
                effect Ultra intelligence had on the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work
                shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives.

                After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic
                Computing Engine, which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing
                joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he
                helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a
                paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
                Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.

                Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment of 1885 had mandated that
                "gross indecency" was a criminal offence in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES,
                as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide
                poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence
                is also consistent with accidental poisoning.

                In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public
                apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II
                granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law
                in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical
                legislation that outlawed homosexual acts</p>
